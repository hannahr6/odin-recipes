      <h2>How to make wontons</h2>
      <p>Want to make delicious cream cheese wontons at home? This is all you need.</p>
      <p>This is a practice project so I am blatantly plagiarizing dinneratthezoo.com.</p>
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>24 wonton wrappers</li>
        <li>8 ounces cream cheese softened
        <li>1/2 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1 egg beaten</li>
        <li>oil for frying</li>
    </ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Combine the cream cheese, sugar, and onion powder. Stir until well mixed.</li>
    <li>Place a wonton wrapper on a flat surface and drop a teaspoon of the cream cheese mixture into the center. Brush the edges of the wonton with the egg.</li>
    <li>Bring 2 opposite corners together in the middle of the wonton and pinch. Repeat with the other 2 corners and pinch to form a package shape.</li>
    <li>Repeat with the remaining wontons and cream cheese until all are filled.</li>
    <li>Heat 4 inches of oil in a deep pan to 350 degrees F.</li>
    <li>Fry 5-6 wontons at a time, turning them as needed to make sure they brown evenly. This process should take about 3-5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Drain the cooked wontons on paper towels and repeat the frying process with remaining wontons.</li>
    <li>Serve immediately with dipping sauce of choice.</li>
</ol>
